# The Tower of Hanoi Game

This is the source code for my LogRocket blog post over [react-dnd](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd). It's a basica Tower of Hanoi game, made with React and styled-components.

To start the project, clone it locally and run the following:

```
cd logrocket-hanoi-tower
yarn start
```

Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) in case you don't have it.
